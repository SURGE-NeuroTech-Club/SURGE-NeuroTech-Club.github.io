This tutorial will take you through the steps of getting you OpenBCI board up and streaming EEG signals!

## Installing The Software

First, you will have to download the latest version of the [OpenBCI GUI (graphical user interface)](https://openbci.com/downloads)
Make sure to download the correct version for your machine! (windows, mac, or linux).

One you have downloaded it, unzip it and move the folder somewhere you will remember!
> The GUI doesn't 'install' so you will have to open the folder to start the program 

Once you open the application `OpenBCI_GUI`, you should see something like this:
![](images/gui-img1.PNG){fig-align="center"}

If you see the red bar at the bottom that reads 'This Application is Not being run with Admin Access...', close it and restart it as an administrator (right click > Run As Administrator > Yes)

If you run into trouble or errors not mentioned here, check out the [official GUI documentation](https://docs.openbci.com/Software/OpenBCISoftware/GUIDocs/) (or ask one of the SURGE folks!)

## Connecting To Your Board

If at any point something doesn't work or make sense - check out the [official documentation on getting your cyton board setup!](https://docs.openbci.com/GettingStarted/Boards/CytonGS/)

Make sure you have your Cyton Board, Dongle, and Battery Pack with 4 AA batteries.

There is a tiny switch on the side of the cyton board: ![](images/cyton-switch.jpg) - **make sure it is in the 'off' position (middle) before pluggin in the battery**.

Once the switch is set to 'off', you may plug in the battery pack ![](images/cyton-plugin.jpg) and change the switch position to 'PC'. **If you do not see a blue light on the board once you switch it to 'PC', the batteries need to be replaced.**

Next, look for the switch on the USB dongle and **make sure the switch is on 'GPIO 6' - towards the plug-end before pluggin it into your computer.
