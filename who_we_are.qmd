We are the Dalhousie/SURGE NeuroTech Club! The goal of the club is to help students with any level of neuroscience or coding experience get engaged and excited about NeuroTechnology! <br>

The club is drop-in and completely free to attend! It runs once a week from <span class='highlight1'>**3-5pm on Thursdays**</span> in the LSC, Oceanography - Room O2660 <br>


## Directions {#directions}

**Life Sciences Building, Oceanography wing - Room O2660**

From the main entrance: go down the stairs and continue past the tim hortons until you see doors leading outside on your right. Go through them and enter the building directly across. Continue straight down the hallway until you see the bathrooms on your left, or the SURGE A-frame sign - then it's the doors on your right!
