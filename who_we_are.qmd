<div class="notice">
  **Important Notice:** The club now meets on **Wednesdays 3-5 pm**.
</div>

We are the Dalhousie/SURGE NeuroTech Club! The goal of the club is to help students with any level of neuroscience or coding experience get engaged and excited about NeuroTechnology! <br>

The club is drop-in and completely free to attend! It runs once a week from <span class='highlight1'>**3-5pm on Wednesdays**</span> in the LSC, Oceanography - Room O2660 <br>


## How to find us! {#directions}

We are located in the **Life Sciences Building, Oceanography wing - Room O2660**

**From the main entrance of the LSC**: take the stairs on the right, walk past Tim Hortons, and exit through the doors on your right. Enter the building across from you, walk straight down the hallway until you see the bathrooms on your left or the SURGE A-frame sign, then head through the doors on your right.

**For wheelchair access to SURGE**: start at Wickwire Field and walk beside the Life Sciences Centre (LSC) toward Oxford Street, passing between the LSC and Shirreff Hall. After the playground, LSC courtyard, and bike locks on your right, youâ€™ll see the ramp just beyond the bike locks.
