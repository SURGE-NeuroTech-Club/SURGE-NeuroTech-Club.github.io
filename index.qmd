### Welcome to the NeuroTech Club Website! 
We are a community of neuro-enthusiasts dedicated to exploring, understanding, and innovating in the field of neurotechnology. Join us as we delve into this exciting frontier!

We meet every <span class='highlight1'>**Wednesday {{< meta club-hours >}}**</span> in the SURGE room [LSC, Room O2660](who_we_are.qmd#directions). If you can't make the full time, no worries - feel free to drop by and check it out!


If you're new to the club and don't know where to begin, you can click on [*Tutorials*](docs/tutorials/index.qmd) to learn more, or just ask one of the SURGE folks!
