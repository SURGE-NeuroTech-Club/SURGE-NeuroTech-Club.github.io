It allows multiple people to work on projects at once without overwriting each other’s changes. GitHub is built on Git, a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files. With GitHub, you can manage and store revisions of projects, share your code with others, view and track changes, and even revert back to previous versions of your code. It’s widely used by software developers for personal projects, open-source projects, and team-based enterprise software development.\n\n\nOnce you’ve made and verified your account, head over to the GitHub Student Developer Pack Application. Make sure Student is selected, and then scroll down to the bottom of the page.\nIf you signed up with your Dalhousie email address, it should automatically detect Dalhousie University as your school. Click Select this School, and then Continue. If you don’t see this, enter your Dalhousie email address and verify it now.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the next page, you will have to take a picture of your Dalhousie Student ID (I reccomend using your laptop webcam for simplicity), and upload it to the"
