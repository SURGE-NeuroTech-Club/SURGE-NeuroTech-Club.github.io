This document will teach you how to setup your computer with GitHub, VSCode and a Virtual Environment so you can start working on python projects!

## Step 1: Installing Visual Studio Code

First, you'll want to download and install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target="_blank"}. Make sure you download the correct version for your computer (Windows, Mac, Linux).

## Step 2: Setting up GitHub

While VS Code is installing, head over to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/login){target="_blank"} and make an account if you don't already have one. Make sure you **use your Dalhousie email** when signing up as this will allow you to sign up for the student developer pack which gives you access to AI tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot){target="_blank"}!

> GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration. It allows multiple people to work on projects at once without overwriting each other's changes. GitHub is built on Git, a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files. With GitHub, you can manage and store revisions of projects, share your code with others, view and track changes, and even revert back to previous versions of your code. It's widely used by software developers for personal projects, open-source projects, and team-based enterprise software development.

Once you've made and verified your account, head over to the [GitHub Student Developer Pack Application.](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application){target="_blank"} Make sure *Student* is selected, and then scroll down to the bottom of the page. 

If you signed up with your Dalhousie email address, it should automatically detect Dalhousie University as your school. Click `Select this School`, and then `Continue`. If you don't see this, enter your Dalhousie email address and verify it now.
